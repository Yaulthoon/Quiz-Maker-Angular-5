Purpose
<p class = 'about'>
Quiz Maker is a single-page application meant to assist individuals that want to 
create basic quizzes for their website and/or personal use.  The quiz is coded in 
a way that those with a basic understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript can modify values 
to further personalize different aspects to suit their personal needs.  This app is a simple, 
but effective solution for teachers, or even students, seeking to create interactive study 
guides that they can share with others.</p>

I do not own a website, can I still use Quiz Maker?
<p class = 'about'>
Yes.  By saving the completed file as a .html extension file, you can open your quiz in 
your internet browser and use it locally.  Sharing the file with others will allow them 
to take your quiz as well.  Quiz Maker makes sharing study guides with peers quick and 
easy.</p>

How do I get started?
<p class = 'about'>
Simply start by styling your quiz starting with "Question Area."  If you do 
not wish to style your quiz, you can skip straight to "Create Questions" to begin 
filling in the questions for your quiz.  The code printed at the end is spaced out 
to be user-friendly and simple to adjust in case you want to add style to your quiz 
yourself at a later time.</p>

responsive web design principles and will scale to the dimensions of your screen.  For 
best results, switch your phone to landscape [wide] mode.</p>

One of the answers to one of my questions is incorrect.  Can I fix this?
<p class = 'about'>
Yes, you can.  This requires a brief explanation of a basic Javascript concept, but this 
solution does not require you to familiarize yourself with Javascript at all.
Open your html document in a text editor such as Notepad, Notepad++, Atom, or etcetera.  
Underneath the &#60;script&#62; tag, find the phrase "const key" that contains a list of 
numbers from 0 - 3.  This is what is known as an array that contains numbers, technically 
string versions of numbers, that form an answer key.  0 being the first answer and 3 being 
the final answer if your question contains 4 possible choices.
Simply identify the number of the question that you want to adjust and find its corresponding 
answer in the array.  This means if you wanted to adjust the answer to question #5, then you 
would find the fifth element in the array and modify it to the new answer. <br/>
<b>
Example:  const key = ["1","2","0","0","3"].  "3" would be the fifth element in the array.
</b></p>

Can I use the code provided by the app as part of a school-related project?
