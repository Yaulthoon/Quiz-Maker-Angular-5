# QuizMaker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

This is a rewrite of my Quiz Maker project from AngularJS.  On the UI side, this version features responsive web design choices for mobile users.  Parts of the code are rewritten to accommodate the necessary changes required for converting between the two libraries.  Notably, this version utilizes the router module instead of AJAX calls for transitioning templates.  I use ngFor to populate questions on the review phase instead of a separate function in this version as well.  Ultimately, I feel this version possesses more eloquent design principles over the initial AngularJs version of Quiz Maker.
